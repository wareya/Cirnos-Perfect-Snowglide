# Editor Input Map
Recreation of the Godot 3 editor's input map for in-game use.

Features:
- Most of what the editor's input map can do.
- The ability to control whether the player can add actions, delete actions, add inputs, and delete inputs.
- Ability to delete the default "ui" actions if you really want to for some reason.

Not extensively tested, so please tell me if there are any bugs!
